# Smart Campus Proposal to make Tech Park Smart

# Elevtrical Energy Conservation


## Problem Formulation:
A significant quantity of energy is consumed by educational blocks from our institution. The appliance runs on a set schedule in most of the blocks. As a result, the appliance remains switched ON whether the user needs it or not. This inefficient electrical energy management results in significant energy waste and high electricity bills.


## Objectives: 
1. Monitoring: Study of the environment in view of electrical energy consumption 2. Intelligence-enabled electrical energy automation system: Development of an IoT-driven building toward an energy-automated environment
3. Electric energy consumption prediction: Including prediction capabilities in smart buildings, the electric energy consumption can be estimated for the near future. Thus, the required amount of energy can be generated and supplied as needed to meet the demands of the electric loads.
